# DS-Gen-AI-Internship- Learning Repository
Welcome to my **Data Science with Gen-AI Internship repository**!
This is where I upload all my tasks, assignments, notebooks, and progress throughout the program.
## Repository Contents
- Basic Python Programming
- Internship Tasks
- Flask Backend Projects
 ## Flask Tasks
This section contains my backend web development projects built using Flask.
Each project focuses on understanding how backend applications work and how Python is used to handle web requests.
## What I learned through Flask tasks:
- Creating web applications using Flask
- Understanding GET vs POST requests
- Handling user input through HTML forms
- Using Jinja templates to display dynamic data
- Validating inputs to avoid empty or invalid submissions
- Debugging common backend issues
- Structuring Flask projects professionally
### Example Projects:
## Note Taking Application
- Add and display notes using forms
- Prevent empty or None inputs
- Clean request handling and routing
## Goals
- Improve Python skills
- Learn Data Science step by step
- Build ML models
- Work with real datasets
## Tools
- Python
- Jupiter Notebook
- Numpy, Pandas
- Flask
## Note
I will keep updating this repository as I complete more tasks in the internship
